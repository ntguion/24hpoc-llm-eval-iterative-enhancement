Suggestions:
  + Include a requirement for clear next steps and responsibilities for each action item.
  + Specify the need for precise language to enhance clarity and reduce ambiguity.
  - Ensure all action items are clearly defined with associated timelines
  - Ensure clear segmentation of topics to enhance readability and coherence.
  + Require logical organization and clear transitions between topics for better flow.
  
Rationale: These improvements address systemic issues observed in the evaluations. Adding a requirement for clear next steps and responsibilities will enhance actionability, while emphasizing precise language will reduce vagueness. Removing redundancy in action item definitions simplifies the prompt. Finally, focusing on logical organization will improve clarity and coherence across all summaries.

Suggestions:
  + Require summaries to explicitly outline all action items with assigned responsibilities and deadlines.
  + Include a requirement for summaries to highlight key discussion points to ensure comprehensive coverage.
  - Prioritize specificity in language to eliminate vagueness.
  - Specify the need for precise language to enhance clarity and reduce ambiguity.

  + Mandate a structured format that clearly segments topics and maintains logical flow.
  
Rationale: These improvements address systemic issues in coverage, actionability, and clarity. By explicitly requiring action items with responsibilities and deadlines, summaries will become more actionable and complete. Highlighting key discussion points ensures that important information is consistently captured. Removing redundant specificity requirements simplifies the prompt, while replacing vague organization instructions with a clear mandate for structure enhances overall coherence and flow.
