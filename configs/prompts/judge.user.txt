CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: You MUST score using these EXACT five dimension names:
- coverage
- factuality
- actionability
- structure_brevity
- safety_compliance

Return valid JSON with "scores" (object mapping each dimension to 1-5), "rationales" (object mapping each dimension to a one-sentence explanation), "hallucinations" (array of quoted text or empty array), and "suggested_prompt_changes" (string with generic diff-style improvements).

Do NOT invent new dimension names. Use the five listed above EXACTLY as written.
