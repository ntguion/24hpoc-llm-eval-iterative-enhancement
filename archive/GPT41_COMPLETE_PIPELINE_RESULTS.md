## üî¨ Technical Analysis

### **Why GPT-4.1 Didn't Improve Much:**

1. **Schema Constraint** - The 12-field schema provides clear structure that both models can follow
2. **Task Simplicity** - Call summarization is relatively straightforward for both models
3. **Rubric Alignment** - Both models can meet the rubric requirements effectively
4. **Diminishing Returns** - Larger models don't always improve simple tasks

### **Why Structure/Brevity Improved:**
- GPT-4.1 has better **writing quality** and **organization**
- More **concise and well-structured** output
- Better **logical flow** in summaries

### **Why Other Dimensions Didn't Improve:**
- **Coverage:** Both models can extract all required fields
- **Factuality:** Both models are accurate with transcript content
- **Actionability:** Both models can structure next steps effectively
- **Safety:** Both models follow compliance requirements

## üéì Key Learnings

### 1. **Model Choice Matters Less Than System Design**
- Good schema + simple prompt > Complex prompt + basic schema
- **Focus on system architecture** rather than model upgrades

### 2. **Cost-Quality Trade-offs Are Real**
- 4x cost increase for 2% improvement is poor ROI
- **Measure value per dollar** not just absolute quality

### 3. **Simple Prompts Can Work Well**
- GPT-4.1 didn't suggest improvements to simple prompt
- **Over-engineering prompts** may not be necessary

### 4. **Production Systems Need Cost Awareness**
- **Scale matters** - 4x cost difference compounds quickly
- **Choose models based on use case** not just capability
