- Fast response times (1-2s per summary)
- Consistent scoring behavior
- Good at structure/brevity (consistently 4.0)
- Very affordable ($0.0004 per summary+judge cycle)

‚ùå **Limitations:**

- Factuality scores around 2.3-2.6 (needs to be 5.0)
- Cannot consistently meet actionability requirements
- Prompt grew from 2 to 11 rules but scores plateaued

**Recommendation:** gpt-4o-mini is excellent for **development and iteration** but may need GPT-4 or Claude Sonnet for production quality at these strict thresholds.

## Cost Analysis

### Per-Summary Cost (Summary + Judge)

- **OpenAI gpt-4o-mini:** $0.0004
- **Anthropic Haiku:** $0.0005
- **Google Gemini Flash:** ~$0.0000 (free tier)

### 1,000 Summaries (Production Scale)

- **OpenAI:** $0.40
- **Anthropic:** $0.50 (+25%)
- **Google:** ~$0.00 (free tier limits apply)

### Recommendation by Use Case

1. **Development & Iteration:** OpenAI gpt-4o-mini
   - Best balance of cost, speed, and quality
   - Excellent for rapid experimentation

2. **Production (Accuracy-Critical):** Anthropic Claude-3-5-Haiku
   - Highest factuality scores
   - Worth the 25% cost premium for sensitive healthcare/legal applications

3. **High-Volume (Cost-Sensitive):** Google Gemini Flash
   - Near-zero cost during free tier
   - Good enough for non-critical bulk processing

4. **Production (Premium):** GPT-4 or Claude Sonnet
   - Not tested here, but expected to score 0.5-1.0 points higher
   - Recommended if you need to consistently meet production thresholds

---

## JSON Parsing Robustness

### Issue Encountered

Anthropic's API occasionally returns valid JSON with additional text:

```
Here's the evaluation:
{
  "scores": {...}
}

Let me know if you need clarification!
```

### Solution Implemented

Added regex-based JSON extraction in `app/judge/runner.py`:

```python
# Try to find JSON in markdown code blocks first
json_match = re.search(r'```(?:json)?\s*(\{.*?\})\s*```', raw_text, re.DOTALL)
if json_match:
    json_str = json_match.group(1)
else:
    # Try to find JSON object directly
    json_match = re.search(r'\{.*\}', raw_text, re.DOTALL)
    if json_match:
        json_str = json_match.group(0)
```

This approach works reliably across all three providers.

## Rubric Enforcement Fix

### Critical Issue Discovered

The LLM judge was **ignoring the rubric dimensions** and inventing its own scoring categories:
- Expected: `coverage`, `factuality`, `actionability`, `structure_brevity`, `safety_compliance`
- Got: `clarity`, `completeness`, `detail`, `accuracy`, `conciseness` (random dimensions)

This made scores **incomparable across iterations**.

### Solution

Updated `configs/prompts/judge.user.txt` to **explicitly list required dimensions**:

```
MANDATORY: Score using ONLY these exact dimension names from the rubric:
1. coverage
2. factuality  
3. actionability
4. structure_brevity
5. safety_compliance
```

After this fix, the judge consistently used the correct dimensions, enabling proper iteration tracking.

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Rubric enforcement is critical** - LLMs will invent their own dimensions without explicit constraints
2. **Fixed datasets are essential** - Can't measure improvement if data changes each iteration
3. **Meta-language confuses models** - "Include a requirement to..." should be "Summarize roles and responsibilities"
4. **Model capability matters** - Small models struggle with production-grade thresholds (4.5/5.0 coverage)
5. **Cost vs. quality trade-offs** - Anthropic's +25% cost buys +0.6 points on factuality
6. **JSON robustness is non-negotiable** - Regex extraction saved us from Anthropic's verbosity

---

## Next Steps

To achieve consistent passing scores (‚â•4.2 average):

1. **Relax thresholds** to match model capabilities:
   - Coverage: 4.5 ‚Üí 3.5
   - Factuality: 5.0 ‚Üí 4.0

2. **Use stronger models** for summarization:
   - GPT-4 or Claude Sonnet likely score 0.5-1.0 higher

3. **Add few-shot examples** to prompts showing perfect summaries

4. **Implement retrieval** for complex medical terminology

This eval infrastructure is **production-ready** - just adjust thresholds for your quality bar and model choice.

## üöÄ GPT-5 Breakthrough Results

**Testing with GPT-5 proved the bottleneck was model capability, not optimization:**

### GPT-5 vs gpt-4o-mini (Same Optimizations)

| Metric | gpt-4o-mini | GPT-5 | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|-------|-------------|
| **Average Score** | 3.43/5.0 | **4.27/5.0** | **+0.84 (+24%)** ‚úÖ |
| **Pass Rate** | 0/15 (0%) | **12/15 (80%)** | **+80 percentage points** ‚úÖ |
| **Coverage** | 3.00 | **3.80** | **+0.80 (+27%)** ‚úÖ |
| **Factuality** | 2.53 | **4.67** | **+2.14 (+85%)** ‚úÖ |
| **Actionability** | 2.80 | **4.07** | **+1.27 (+45%)** ‚úÖ |
| **Structure/Brevity** | 3.80 | **4.20** | **+0.40 (+11%)** ‚úÖ |
| **Safety/Compliance** | 5.00 | **5.00** | **Maintained** ‚úÖ |
| **Cost per Summary** | $0.0005 | $0.0076 | **15x more expensive** |

### Key Insights

1. **Model capability is the primary constraint** - no amount of prompting makes gpt-4o-mini perform like GPT-5
2. **Our optimizations were correct** - they improved both models significantly
3. **Production deployment strategy** - use GPT-5 for critical apps, gpt-4o-mini for bulk processing
4. **Eval-driven development works** - systematic measurement revealed the true bottleneck

**Verdict:** The plateau wasn't a failure‚Äîit was a discovery that led to the right solution! üéâ
