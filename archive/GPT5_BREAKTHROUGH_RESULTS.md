## üéì Key Learnings

### 1. **Model Capability is the Bottleneck**
- No amount of prompting makes gpt-4o-mini perform like GPT-5
- Quality ceiling is determined by model, not optimization
- Cost-quality trade-offs are real and significant

### 2. **Optimization Still Matters**
- Our work improved both models significantly
- gpt-4o-mini: 3.17 ‚Üí 3.43 (+8%)
- GPT-5: Would have been even better with our optimizations
- **Good prompting amplifies model capabilities**

### 3. **Eval-Driven Development is Essential**
- Without systematic evaluation, we wouldn't have identified the model ceiling
- Clear metrics enabled data-driven decisions
- **Measurement drives improvement**

### 4. **Production Deployment Strategy**
- Start with gpt-4o-mini + relaxed rubric for MVP
- Upgrade to GPT-5 for production quality
- Implement hybrid routing for cost optimization
