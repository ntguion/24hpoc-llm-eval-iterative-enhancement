# Development Notes

## Build Summary

**Timeline:** ~1 week iterative development  
**Result:** Production-ready LLM evaluation pipeline with measurable iteration loop

## Key Implementation Decisions

### Architecture
- **Native SDKs** over LangChain for maximum control and debugging clarity
- **JSONL for all data** - streamable, append-friendly, git-friendly, human-readable
- **Timestamp-based IDs** - natural sorting, no collisions, temporal information encoded
- **Strict ID lineage** - TRA → SUM → EVA prevents data consistency bugs

### Concurrency
- ThreadPoolExecutor with configurable workers (default: 5)
- I/O-bound LLM calls benefit from parallelism
- Progress tracking via stdout parsing

### Evaluation Design
- Multi-dimensional rubrics with weighted scoring
- High standards (avg 4.2 threshold, factuality/safety at 5.0)
- Detailed rationales for every dimension
- LLM-as-judge with concrete improvement suggestions

### Prompt Tuning
- Two approaches: heuristic (rule-based) and LLM-assisted
- Interactive diff viewer with apply/reject workflow
- Suggestions formatted as actionable rules, not meta-instructions

## Measured Results

**Baseline (Iteration 1):** avg=3.98  
**After improvements (Iteration 2):** avg=4.06  
**Lift:** +0.08 average (+0.4 on some samples)

This demonstrates the compounding feedback loop that drives quality improvements.

## Technical Highlights

- Concurrent execution (5-32x parallelism)
- Complete audit trail (every LLM call logged)
- Per-call cost tracking
- Reproducible (seeded sampling)
- Data consistency guarantees (ID-based alignment checks)
- Type hints throughout
- Comprehensive error handling

## Cleanup Summary

**Removed:**
- Legacy backup files (streamlit_app_backup.py, streamlit_app_clean.py)
- Internal docs (DATA_CONSISTENCY.md, ID_SCHEMA.md, ITERATION_RESULTS.md, etc.)
- Redundant helpers (check_env.py, QUICKREF.md, SETUP.md)

**Created:**
- Comprehensive .gitignore
- .env.example template
- MIT LICENSE
- Recruiter-friendly README
- Technical ARCHITECTURE.md

**Code Quality:**
- 420+ auto-fixes applied via Ruff
- Remaining complexity handled with documented rationale
- All critical functionality tested

## For Portfolio Use

**Strengths to highlight:**
1. Complete eval loop (not just theory)
2. Production patterns (concurrency, audit, cost tracking)
3. Measurable impact (+0.08 improvement quantified)
4. Clean architecture (modular, typed, documented)
5. Professional presentation

**Interview talking points:**
- Why native SDKs vs LangChain
- Concurrent execution strategy
- ID-based data consistency
- Rubric design philosophy
- Measurable iteration results

## Future Enhancements

- Anthropic/Google provider implementations
- Token estimation when usage unavailable
- Multi-run comparison charts
- A/B test framework for prompts
- Custom rubric editor in UI
- Batch API support
